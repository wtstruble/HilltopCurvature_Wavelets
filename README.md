# HilltopCurvature
 
These MATLAB scripts calculate hilltop curvature, using both 2D continuous wavelet transforms and 2D polynomial functions, as described in Struble and Roering (2021)<sup><b><i>(1)</i></b></sup>.

The script entitled HilltopCurvature_LidarSites.m walks you through applying the wavelet transform and polynomial fuction to your topographic data. An example lidar DEM of a portion of the Oregon Coast Range is included. Note that this script is dependent on TopoToolbox (Schwanghart and Sherler, 2014)<sup><b><i>(2)</i></b></sup>, which can be accessed at topotoolbox.wordpress.com. The wavelet script utilized in HilltopCurvature_LidarSites.m is conv2_mexh_curv.m, which is a derivative of the Landslide Mapping Toolbox from Dr. Adam Booth at Portland State University. The full toolbox can be accessed at http://web.pdx.edu/~boothad/tools.html. 

The script entitled Sythetic.m constructs syntehtic hillslopes using the functional form for a soil-mantled hillslope experiencing nonlinear diffusion, as described in Roering et al. (2007)<sup><b><i>(3)</i></b></sup>. TopoToolbox is not required for this script.
